# Java Programs Collection

This repository contains various Java programs covering topics such as loops, arrays, conditionals, enums, patterns, and more. Each program demonstrates different concepts and problem-solving approaches.

## Files and Descriptions

1. **NestedIfExample.java**  
   Demonstrates nested `if` statements for decision making.

2. **NestedIfExample1.java**  
   Another example of nested `if` statements with multiple conditions.

3. **LeapYearCheck.java**  
   Checks whether a given year is a leap year.

4. **TriangleCheck.java**  
   Determines the type of triangle based on side lengths.

5. **EnumSwitchExample.java**  
   Demonstrates using enums with switch-case statements.

6. **LoopsExample.java**  
   Demonstrates `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in Java.

7. **TrianglePattern.java**  
   Prints various triangle patterns using loops.

8. **ForWithArray.java**  
   Iterates over an array using `for` loop and demonstrates escape characters in output.

9. **TwoSum.java**  
   Solves the Two Sum problem using arrays.

10. **TwoArrayIncreasing.java**  
    Checks if two adjacent subarrays of length k are strictly increasing.

11. **MergeTwoSortedArray.java**  
    Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

12. **Palindrome.java**  
    Checks if a given number is a palindrome.

13. **ReverseInteger.java**  
    Reverses a given integer.

14. **LoadingAnimation.java**  
    Demonstrates a console-based loading animation using loops.

15. **Main.java**  
    Contains a comprehensive program (e.g., menu-driven system) demonstrating multiple concepts.
